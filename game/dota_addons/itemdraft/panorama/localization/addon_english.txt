  "draftdescription" "
    <p>Draft the items you will receive over the course of the game. Each level you will get 600xp, which can be spent
    on the items you draft.</p>

    <p>You draft until you are out of experience to spend. You have 5s to draft each item, so think about what you want
    while others draft! If you don't draft in time, you will get a random item!</p>

  "addondescription" "
    <p>This game mode is in <span class=\"alpha\">alpha</span>! It is a very early version, expect bugs, imbalance, and
    a lack of polish. Please report bugs and request features at the GitHub repository
    (<a href=\"https://github.com/Lattyware/itemdraft\">git.io/itemdraft</a>). Thanks for taking
    the time to try Item Draft!</p>

    <p>Item draft is a game mode where dota is flipped around - draft your items, and level up to get them, while
    buying abilities with your hard-earned gold!</p>

    <p>When you draft an item, you only get that exact item (not it's build up) - remember not to draft too
    greedily!</p>

    <p>Remember that when you pick your hero, you don't get their skills. (Unless you buy them!)</p>

    <p>As you level up, you can spend your experience on items you drafted. You can draft items until you have 25
    levels worth of experience.</p>

    <p>You have five seconds per draft! Try to think about your drafts while others are drafting. If you don't draft
    in time, you will get a random item!</p>

    <p>Some consumables (and the gem) still get bought with gold.</p>
