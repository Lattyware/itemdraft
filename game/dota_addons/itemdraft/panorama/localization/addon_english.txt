    <p>This game mode is in <span class=\"alpha\">alpha</span>! It is a very early version, expect bugs, imbalance, and
    a lack of polish. Please report bugs and request features at the GitHub repository
    (<a href=\"https://github.com/Lattyware/itemdraft\">git.io/itemdraft</a>). Thanks for taking
    the time to try Item Draft!</p>

    <p>Item draft is a game mode where dota is flipped around - draft your items, and level up to get them, while
    buying abilities with your hard-earned gold!</p>

    <p>When you draft an item, you only get that exact item (not it's build up) - remember not to draft too
    greedily!</p>

    <p>Remember that when you pick your hero, you don't get their skills. (Unless you buy them!)</p>

    <p>As you level up, you can spend your experience on items you drafted. You can draft items until you have 25
    levels worth of experience.</p>

    <p>You have five seconds per draft! Try to think about your drafts while others are drafting. If you don't draft
    in time, you will get a random item!</p>

    <p>Some consumables (and the gem) still get bought with gold.</p>
