  "addondescription"  "Item draft is a game mode where dota is flipped around - draft your items, and level up to getthem, while buying abilities with your hard-earned gold!

Remember that when you pick your hero, you don't get their skills. (Unless you buy them!)

As you level up, you can spend your experience on items you drafted. You can draft items until you have 25 levels of experience worth.

Items that are not consumable or component items, as well as recipes, can only be drafted by one person! Get them quick or miss out!

Some consumables (and the gem) still get bought with gold."
