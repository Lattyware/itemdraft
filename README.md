# Item Draft
Item Draft custom game mode for Dota 2, where skills and items are swapped. This is an initial draft of the base idea, once development starts, doing things another way might be more viable, and once created, changes may be made for balance.

## Status

Development underway.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/Lattyware/itemdraft/wiki/Item-Draft) for plans and implementation detail.
